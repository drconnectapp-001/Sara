**7.1** **Introduction**

In earlier classes, we have learnt how to find the squares
and cubes of binomials like *a*+*b* and *a*–*b*. Using them, we
could evaluate the numerical values of numbers like
(98)2 = (100 – 2)2, (999)3 = (1000 – 1)3, etc. However, for
higher powers like (98)5, (101)6, etc., the calculations become
difficult by using repeated multiplication. This difficulty was
overcome by a theorem known as binomial theorem. It gives
an easier way to expand (*a*+*b*)*n*, where *n* is an integer or a
rational number. In this Chapter, we study binomial theorem
for positive integral indices only.

**7.2** **Binomial Theorem for Positive Integral Indices**

Let us have a look at the following identities done earlier:
(*a+* *b*)0 = 1
*a* + *b*≠ 0
(*a+* *b*)1 = *a* + *b*
(*a+* *b*)2 = *a*2 + 2*ab*+ *b*2

(*a+* *b*)3 = *a*3 + 3*a*2*b*+ 3*ab*2 + *b*3

| ( | a+ | b | ) | 4 | = ( | a | + | b | ) | 3 | ( | a | + | b | ) = | a | 4 | + 4 | a | 3 | b | + 6 | a | 2 | b | 2 | + 4 | ab | 3 | + | b | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

In these expansions, we observe that
(i)
The total number of terms in the expansion is one more than the index. For
example, in the expansion of (*a +* *b*)2 , number of terms is 3 whereas the index of
(*a* + *b*)2 is 2.
(ii)
Powers of the first quantity ‘*a*’ go on decreasing by 1 whereas the powers of the
second quantity ‘*b*’ increase by 1, in the successive terms.
(iii)
| In each term of the expansion, the sum of the indices of | a | and | b | is the same and |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

is equal to the index of *a*+*b*.

## BINOMIAL THEOREM

BINOMIAL THEOREM       127

We now arrange the coefficients in these expansions as follows (Fig 7.1):

Do we observe any pattern in this table that will help us to write the next row? Yes we
do. It can be seen that the addition of 1’s in the row for index 1 gives rise to 2 in the row
for index 2. The addition of 1, 2 and 2, 1 in the row for index 2, gives rise to 3 and 3 in
the row for index 3 and so on. Also, 1 is present at the beginning and at the end of each
row. This can be continued till any index of our interest.
We can extend the pattern given in Fig 7.2 by writing a few more rows.

**Pascal’s Triangle**
The structure given in Fig 7.2  looks like a triangle with 1 at the top vertex and running
| down the two slanting sides. This array of numbers is known as | Pascal’s triangle | , |
| --- | --- | --- |

after the name of French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is also known as *Meru*
*Prastara* by Pingla.
Expansions for the higher powers of a binomial are also possible by using Pascal’s
triangle. Let us expand (2*x*+ 3*y*)5 by using Pascal’s triangle. The row for index 5 is
Using this row and our observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we get
(2*x*+ 3*y*)5
| = (2 | x | ) | 5 | + 5(2 | x | ) | 4 | (3 | y | ) + 10(2 | x | ) | 3 | (3 | y | ) | 2 | +10 (2 | x | ) | 2 | (3 | y | ) | 3 | + 5(2 | x | )(3 | y | ) | 4 | +(3 | y | ) | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| = 32 | x | 5 | + 240 | x | 4 | y + 720 | x | 3 | y | 2 | + 1080 | x | 2 | y | 3 | + 810 | xy | 4 | + 243 | y | 5 | . |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Now, if we want to find the expansion of (2 | x | + 3 | y | ) | 12 | , we are first required to get |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

the row for index 12. This can be done by writing all the rows of the Pascal’s triangle
till index 12. This is a slightly lengthy process. The process, as you observe, will become
more difficult, if we need the expansions involving still larger powers.
We thus try to find a rule that will help us to find the expansion of the binomial for
any power without writing all the rows of the Pascal’s triangle, that come before the
row of the desired index.
For this, we make use of the concept of combinations studied earlier to rewrite

the numbers in the Pascal’s triangle. We know that

| n | is a non-negative integer. Also, | n | C | 0 | = 1 = | n | C | n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The Pascal’s triangle can now be rewritten as (Fig 7.3)

Observing this pattern, we can now write the row of the Pascal’s triangle for any index
without writing the earlier rows. For example, for the index 7 the row would be

7C0  7C1
7C2
7C3
7C4
7C5
7C6
7C7.
Thus, using this row and the observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we have

(*a*+*b*)7 = 7C0 *a*7
| + 7C | 1 | a | 6 | b | + | 7 | C | 2 | a | 5 | b | 2 | + | 7 | C | 3 | a | 4 | b | 3 | + 7C | 4 | a | 3 | b | 4 | + | 7 | C | 5 | a | 2 | b | 5 | + | 7 | C | 6 | ab | 6 | + | 7 | C | 7 | b | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| An expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index say | n | can now be visualised |
| --- | --- | --- |

using these observations. We are now in a position to write the expansion of a binomial
to any positive integral index.

BINOMIAL THEOREM       129

**7.2.1**
| Binomial theorem | for any positive integer n | , |
| --- | --- | --- |

| ( | a | + | b | ) | n | = | n | C | 0 | a | n | + | n | C | 1 | a | n | –1 | b | + | n | C | 2 | a | n | – | 2 | b | 2 | + ...+ | n | C | n | – 1 | a | . | b | n | –1 | + | n | C | n | b | n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Proof** The proof is obtained by applying principle of mathematical induction.

Let the given statement be

| P( | n | ) : ( | a | + | b | ) | n | = | n | C | 0 | a | n | + | n | C | 1 | a | n | – 1 | b | + | n | C | 2 | a | n | – 2 | b | 2 | + ...+ | n | C | n | –1 | a | . | b | n | – 1 | + | n | C | n | b | n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

For *n* = 1, we have

P (1) : (*a* + *b*)1 = 1C0*a*1 + 1C1*b*1 = *a* + *b*

Thus, P (1) is true.

| Suppose P ( | k | ) is true for some positive integer | k | , i.e. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| ( | a | + | b | ) | k | = | k | C | 0 | a | k | + | k | C | 1 | a | k | – 1 | b | + | k | C | 2 | a | k | – 2 | b | 2 | + ...+ | k | C | k | b | k |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

. . .
(1)

We shall prove that P(*k*+ 1) is also true, i.e.,

| ( | a | + | b | ) | k | + 1 | = | k | + 1 | C | 0 | a | k | + 1 | + | k | + 1 | C | 1 | a | k | b | + | k | + 1 | C | 2 | a | k | – 1 | b | 2 | + ...+ | k | + 1 | C | k | +1 | b | k | + 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Now, (*a*+*b*)*k*+ 1 = (*a*+*b*) (*a*+*b*)*k*

| = ( | a | + | b | ) ( | k | C | 0 | a | k | + | k | C | 1 | a | k | – 1 | b | + | k | C | 2 | a | k | – 2 | b | 2 | +...+ | k | C | k | – 1 | ab | k | – 1 | + | k | C | k | b | k | ) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

[by actual multiplication]

| = | k | C | 0 | a | k | + 1 | + ( | k | C | 1 | + | k | C | 0 | ) | a | k | b | + ( | k | C | 2 | + | k | C | 1 | ) | a | k | – 1 | b | 2 | + ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

+ (*k*C*k*+*k*C*k*–1) *ab**k* + *k*C*k**b**k*+ 1
[grouping like terms]

= *k*+ 1C0*a**k*+ 1 + *k*+ 1C1*a**k**b*+ *k*+ 1C2
*a**k*– 1b2 +...+ *k*+ 1C*k**ab**k* + *k*+ 1C*k*+ 1 *b**k*+1

(by using  *k*+ 1C0=1,  *k*C*r* + *k*C*r*–1 =  *k*+ 1C*r*
and   *k*C*k*  = 1= *k*+ 1C*k*+ 1)

| Thus, it has been proved that P ( | k | + 1) is true whenever P( | k | ) is true. Therefore, by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| principle of mathematical induction, P( | n | ) is true for every positive integer | n | . |

| We illustrate this theorem by expanding ( | x | + 2) | 6 | : |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| ( | x | + 2) | 6 | = | 6 | C | 0 | x | 6 | + | 6 | C | 1 | x | 5 | .2 + | 6 | C | 2 | x | 4 | 2 | 2 | + | 6 | C | 3 | x | 3 | .2 | 3 | + | 6 | C | 4 | x | 2 | .2 | 4 | + | 6 | C | 5 | x | .2 | 5 | + | 6 | C | 6 | .2 | 6 | . |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

= *x*6 + 12*x*5 + 60*x*4 + 160*x*3 + 240*x*2 + 192*x* + 64

| Thus ( | x | + 2) | 6 | = | x | 6 | + 12 | x | 5 | + 60 | x | 4 | + 160 | x | 3 | + | 240 | x | 2 | + 192 | x | + 64. |

The coefficients *n*C*r* occuring in the binomial theorem are known as binomial

| There are ( | n | +1) terms in the expansion of ( | a | + | b | ) | n | , i.e., one more than the index. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| In the successive terms of the expansion the index of | a | goes on decreasing by |
| --- | --- | --- |

unity. It is *n* in the first term, (*n*–1) in the second term, and so on ending with zero

(i)
Taking *a* =*x* and *b*= –*y*, we obtain

(*x*– *y)**n*

**Example 2** Compute (98)5.

Write 98 = 100 – 2
Therefore, (98)5 = (100 – 2)5

**Example 3** Which is larger (1.01)1000000 or 10,000?

**Solution** Splitting 1.01 and using binomial theorem to write the first few terms we
have

(1.01)1000000 = (1 + 0.01)1000000

= 1000000C0 + 1000000C1(0.01) + other positive terms

= 1 + 1000000 × 0.01 + other positive terms

= 1 + 10000 + other positive terms

Hence

| Solution | For two numbers | a | and | b | if we can find numbers | q | and | r | such that |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a | = | bq | + | r | , then we say that | b | divides | a | with | q | as quotient and | r | as remainder. Thus, in |

order to show that  6*n*– 5*n* leaves remainder 1 when divided by 25, we prove that
6*n*– 5*n* = 25*k*+ 1, where *k* is some natural number.

We have

(1 + *a*)*n* = *n*C0 + *n*C1*a* + *n*C2*a*2 + ... + *n*C*n**a**n*

For *a*    = 5, we get

| (1 + 5) | n | = | n | C | 0 | + | n | C | 1 | 5 + | n | C | 2 | 5 | 2 | + ... + | n | C | n | 5 | n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

i.e.
(6)*n* = 1 + 5*n* + 52.*n*C2
+ 53.*n*C3 + ... + 5*n*

i.e.
6*n* – 5*n* = 1+52 (*n*C2
+*n*C35 + ... + 5*n*-2)

or
6*n* – 5*n* = 1+ 25 (*n*C2 + 5 .*n*C3 + ... + 5*n*-2)

or
| 6 | n | – 5 | n | = 25 | k | +1 | where | k | = | n | C | 2 | + 5 | . | n | C | 3 | + ... + 5 | n | –2 | . |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| This shows that when divided by 25, 6 | n | – 5 | n | leaves remainder 1. |

***Summary***

| ® | The expansion of a binomial for any positive integral | n | is given by Binomial |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Theorem, which is ( | a | + | b | ) | n | = | n | C | 0 | a | n | + | n | C | 1 | a | n | – 1 | b | + | n | C | 2 | a | n | – 2 | b | 2 | + ...+ |

*n*C*n*– 1*a*.*b**n*– 1 + *n*C*n**b**n**.*
®The coefficients of the expansions are arranged in an array. This array is
called *Pascal’s triangle*.

***Historical Note***

The ancient Indian mathematicians knew about the coefficients in the
expansions of (*x*+*y*)*n*, 0 ≤ *n*≤ 7. The arrangement of these coefficients was in
| the form of a diagram called | Meru-Prastara | , provided by Pingla in his book |
| --- | --- | --- |

*Chhanda shastra*(200B.C.). This triangular arrangement is also found in the
work of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients
was first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-1567) in
approximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of
| ( | a | + | b | ) | n | , for | n | = 1,2 ...,7 and Oughtred (1631) gave them for | n | = 1, 2,..., 10. The |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| arithmetic triangle, popularly known as | Pascal’s triangle | and similar to the | Meru- |

*Prastara* of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal
(1623-1662) in 1665.
| The present form of the binomial theorem  for integral values of | n | appeared in |

*Trate du triange arithmetic*, written by Pascal and published posthumously in
1665.
